The [v7][] tag on the tip of the [scorer][] branch marks a version of [MinGLE][] that uses [G4ScoringManager][] to record some important statistical parameters from a [Geant4][] simulation. Run `mingle run.mac` to generate one CSV file, which record numbers of protons going through detector volume `Shape1`, and two PNG files, one shows only detector geometry, and the other shows dose distributions right after the detector volume `Shape2`.
